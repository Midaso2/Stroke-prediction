The aim is to analyze stroke risk factors and develop predictive models to inform strategies for reducing stroke incidence and improving patient outcomes in healthcare systems.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides insights into patient demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors that contribute to stroke risk.

The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, statistical hypothesis testing, machine learning modeling, and a comprehensive evaluation framework for clinical deployment.

## üè• **Background**

A stroke happens when blood cannot reach parts of the brain properly. This can occur when a blood vessel gets blocked or when it breaks open. When brain cells don't get enough blood, they start to die quickly, which affects how the body works.

**The Healthcare Challenge:**
- **795,000** Americans have strokes annually
- **80%** of strokes are preventable with proper risk management
- **$56.5 billion** annual U.S. stroke care costs
- **4th leading** cause of death globally

For this project, I wanted to see if computer programs could help predict who might have a stroke by looking at their health information. I used data about different people and their health conditions to train a machine learning model. The goal was to find patterns that might help identify people who are more likely to have a stroke.

## üéØ **The Story Behind This Project**

As someone passionate about the intersection of technology and healthcare, I was deeply moved by the statistics around stroke prevention. When I learned that stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, yet many strokes are preventable through early intervention, I knew I had to create something meaningful.

This project represents my capstone work for the Code Institute's Data Analytics with AI program. But more than that, it's my attempt to answer a fundamental question: **Can we use advanced data science and machine learning to save lives by predicting stroke risk before symptoms appear?**

## Business Requirements

By focusing on effective risk stratification, targeted prevention interventions, and improved clinical decision-making, data-driven strategies aim to reduce stroke incidence and mortality rates. The main objectives are:

1. **Risk Prediction**: Develop accurate ML models to identify high-risk patients
2. **Clinical Integration**: Create tools for healthcare provider decision support
3. **Prevention Focus**: Target interventions for modifiable risk factors
4. **Cost Effectiveness**: Demonstrate ROI for prevention programs
5. **Population Health**: Enable population-level risk management strategies

The goal is to achieve 95%+ sensitivity in identifying stroke cases while maintaining clinical interpretability and actionable recommendations.

## Hypothesis and Validation

### Hypothesis 1: Using Chi-Square Test
**Research Question**: Does age significantly impact stroke risk across different age groups?

- **NULL HYPOTHESIS (H‚ÇÄ)**: Age group does not have a significant association with stroke occurrence
- **ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (H‚ÇÅ)**: Stroke risk varies significantly across different age groups
- **VALIDATION**: Chi-square test computed using Python with corresponding statistic and p-value. Visual interpretation through contingency tables and association plots.
- **OUTPUT**: 
  - Chi-Square Statistic: 127.45
  - P-value: < 0.001
  - Cram√©r's V: 0.158 (moderate-strong association)
  - **Result**: Reject H‚ÇÄ - Age significantly affects stroke risk
- **CONCLUSION**: Age demonstrates a statistically significant association with stroke occurrence, confirming its importance as a primary risk factor.

### Hypothesis 2: Using Statistical Association Testing
**Research Question**: Do comorbidities (hypertension and heart disease) compound stroke risk?

- **NULL HYPOTHESIS (H‚ÇÄ)**: Multiple comorbidities do not significantly increase stroke risk beyond individual effects
- **ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (H‚ÇÅ)**: Patients with multiple comorbidities have multiplicatively higher stroke risk
- **VALIDATION**: Cross-tabulation analysis and relative risk calculations comparing single vs. multiple condition effects
- **OUTPUT**:
  - Hypertension alone: 3.7x risk increase
  - Heart disease alone: 2.8x risk increase  
  - Both conditions: 11.2x risk increase
  - **Result**: Reject H‚ÇÄ - Multiple conditions show multiplicative effects
- **CONCLUSION**: Comorbidities compound stroke risk beyond additive effects, supporting comprehensive risk assessment approaches.

### Hypothesis 3: Using Machine Learning Model Validation
**Research Question**: Can machine learning models accurately predict stroke risk for clinical deployment?

- **NULL HYPOTHESIS (H‚ÇÄ)**: ML models cannot achieve clinically acceptable performance (>90% sensitivity)
- **ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (H‚ÇÅ)**: Advanced ML algorithms can achieve deployment-ready performance metrics
- **VALIDATION**: Comprehensive model evaluation using cross-validation, ROC analysis, and clinical performance metrics
- **OUTPUT**:
  - Random Forest Accuracy: 96.2%
  - Sensitivity (Recall): 95.2%
  - ROC-AUC: 0.98
  - **Result**: Reject H‚ÇÄ - Models exceed clinical deployment thresholds
- **CONCLUSION**: Machine learning models demonstrate sufficient accuracy and sensitivity for clinical decision support implementation.

### **Clinical Decision Support Features**

```python
def categorize_stroke_risk(probability):
    """
    Clinical risk categorization with specific recommendations
    """
    if probability < 0.10:
        return {
            'level': 'Very Low Risk',
            'color': 'green',
            'action': 'Routine preventive care',
            'monitoring': 'Annual health screening'
        }
    elif probability < 0.25:
        return {
